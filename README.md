Abstract
--------

This card game has obvious inspirations from Bitcoin and its miners' race in the network.
Any prior knowledge is not required. Moreover, cards got information that might learn you a thing or two.
Each players act like a Node, competing to mine Blocks faster than the others using HashRates (computational power).
Blocks cost increasingly more HashRates to mine but always rewards a single Coin.
The longest Chain of Blocks will end the game. The player with the most Blocks and Coins wins.
