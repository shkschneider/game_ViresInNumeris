Cards
-----

- HashRates / Coins
- Events: play right away
- Actions: play on your turn
  - Some are paid
  - Some can be played anytime

Setup
-----

You will need a source of randomness: a coin to flip usually works.

- Garbage: used Actions
- Deck: cards to draw
- Pool: used HashRates
- Chain: your Blocks
- Bank: your Coins
- Hand: your cards yet to play

Flow
----

Each player starts with a Genesis Block and a base reward.
Each turn, you draw cards: HashRates, Events or Actions.
Play those cards to favor yourself or attack your opponent(s).
With enough HashRates, you can mine a Block.
Blocks cost increasingly more HashRates to mine but always rewards a single Coin.
The longest Chain of Blocks will end the game.
The player with the most Blocks and Coins wins.
